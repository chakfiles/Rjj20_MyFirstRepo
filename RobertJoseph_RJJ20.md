# My First GitHub Repository

## New to GitHuB

## About Me
My name is Robert Joseph, and this is my first GitHub repository created as part of my learning journey.

### What I Learned
- How to create a new repository on GitHub.
- Basics of Markdown.


### What I'm Confused About
- I'm still getting the hang of github in general im currently trying to experiment with sutff but its all so confusing. I didn't know that github was this advanced in what it could do. Usually when I used to look at it,
- it was to look at others code as a resource but now that im actually naviating it in this capcity its alot different.
